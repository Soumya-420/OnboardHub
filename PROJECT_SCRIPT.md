### [0:00-0:30] The Hook: "Analysis Paralysis"
**(Visual: Screen recording of scrolling through a massive GitHub repo, looking confused. Or a montage of "Error: failed to compile" logs.)**

**You:** "We've all been there. You want to contribute to Open Source. You find a cool repository... and then you freeze."

**You:** "There are 500 files. The documentation is confusing. You spend 4 hours just trying to run `npm install`. And even if you fix it, you have that nagging fear: *'Is this project even active? Will my PR just sit there for months?'*"

**You:** "This is called **Analysis Paralysis**, and it kills thousands of potential contributions every year. That's why I built **OnboardHub**."

### [0:30-0:50] The Solution: Introducing OnboardHub
**(Visual: Smooth transition to the OnboardHub Landing Page. Typing animation "Stop Staring... Start Coding" plays.)**

**You:** "OnboardHub is an intelligent bridge between aspiring contributors and complex codebases. It doesn't just list issues; it **analyzes, simplifies, and guides** you through the entire contribution lifecycle."

### [0:50-2:00] Feature Walkthrough
**(Visual: Enter a Repo URL (e.g., React or the Demo mode) and click "Launch Analyzer".)**

**You:** "Let's see it in action. I'll paste a GitHub repository link here. In seconds, OnboardHub performs a deep dive analysis."

#### 1. Repository Intelligence & Mentor Readiness
**(Visual: Zoom in on the Gauge and Health Score.)**

**You:** "First, check this out. The **Repo Health Score**. It checks for critical docs like CONTRIBUTING.md. But more importantly, look at the **Mentor Readiness Gauge**. It analyzes maintainer activity to tell you: *'Yes, if you submit code here, you will actually get a review.'* No more ghost towns."

#### 2. Specialized Issue Finder
**(Visual: Toggling between 'Beginner', 'Intermediate', and 'Pro' tabs.)**

**You:** "Next, forget scrolling through endless issues. OnboardHub categorizes tasks by **real complexity**. Beginners get documentation fixes. Pros get architecture changes. It matches the task to *your* actual level."

#### 3. Auto-Setup Commands
**(Visual: 'Start Here' card showing the copy-paste commands.)**

**You:** "Stuck on setup? OnboardHub detects the tech stack—whether it's Next.js, Python, or Rust—and generates the **exact CLI commands** you need to start the local server. One click copy, and you're running."

#### 4. The "Mic Drop": Smart Proposal Drafter
**(Visual: Clicking 'Draft Application' on an issue. Showing the modal filling up with Markdown.)**

**You:** "And here is the game changer. You found an issue, but how do you apply? Click **'Draft Application'**."

**You:** "OnboardHub reads the issue context and generates a professional, structured application proposal. It includes a technical approach, timeline, and even a 'Why Me' section based on your skills. It turns you from a 'newbie' into a 'professional' instantly."

### [2:00-2:30] Closing
**(Visual: Clicking 'Copy' -> Confetti Effect -> Footer "Drafted via OnboardHub")**

**You:** "With OnboardHub, we aren't just finding issues. We are removing the fear of the 'First PR'. We are turning analysis paralysis into merged code."

**You:** "This is OnboardHub. Ready for Winter of Code 5.0."
