# Contributing to OnboardHub

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉

OnboardHub is built to help beginners, so we strive to make our own contribution process as beginner-friendly as possible.

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

1.  **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2.  **Clone your fork**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/OnboardHub.git
    cd OnboardHub
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies & Start**:
    We have a unified script for this!
    ```bash
    .\start_app.bat
    ```
    This will install dependencies for both Frontend and Backend and start them on `localhost:3000` and `localhost:5000`.

## 💻 Project Structure

- **`frontend/`**: Next.js 14 Application (UI)
- **`backend/`**: Express.js Server (GitHub API Logic)

3.  Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`
4.  Push to the branch: `git push origin fix/amazing-feature`
