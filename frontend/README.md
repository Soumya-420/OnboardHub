## 🏆 The Problem
Contributing to open source is terrifying.
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Thousands of files with no clear entry point.
- **Setup Hell**: "npm install" failing with cryptic errors.
- **Imposter Syndrome**: "Is this issue too hard for me?"

## 💡 The Solution
**OnboardHub** is your **Senior Developer Buddy**. It scans any GitHub repository and provides:
1.  **Deep Analysis**: A 0-100 "Beginner Readiness" score based on real-time activity.
2.  **Smart Application Drafter**: Generates a professional proposal tailored to YOUR skills.
3.  **Compatibility Profiler**: Matches issues to your expertise (React, TS, etc.).

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Beginner Readiness Gauge 🛡️
Don't waste time on dead repos. We analyze response times, PR merge rates, and documentation quality to tell you if maintainers are actually active.

### 2. Candidate Compatibility Profiler 🎯
Type in your skills (e.g., `React`, `Tailwind`). We scan the issues and give you a **Match Score**.
> *"You are a 95% match for Issue #102!"*

### 3. Smart Application Drafter ✍️
Struggling to write a proposal? One click generates a structured, professional markdown application, referencing specific files and potential fixes.
*(Drafted via OnboardHub, safe for all hackathons!)*
